    <p align="center" style="margin-bottom: 11px">the first chloe catastrophe full length. writing this now, about a year since this release and my first time revisiting it since, i was mostly surprised by just how dark it was. there were portions i recall being hard to sit through, but overall it was cast in a shadow i no longer think i have, or it has at least taken a different form. the a side, a 45ish minute sound collage piece was constructed over the course of a month via recording directly from my pc to the same cassette tape and just stopping and starting until it was full, choosing a C90 i had around to do this on led to it being a considerably lengthy task. in beginning i didn't know much of what i was going for, but in working on it - and by the time it was done - it had developed into two things. one being a voicing of the idea that your algorithm creates a mirror-you, the collage sounds coming from content consumed predominantly on youtube, but from the internet in general. content suggested to you, an idea of what you might consume, feeds you content that can make you feel, see, act and consume in a particular way, and such the feedback loop continues between you and the algo-self. how seperate are you from this person really? the second thing came from the more personal place of alienation i was, and still find myself in today. it was a time of identity finding, and first finding my voice, my first "thing" i'd put together, which sort of ties to the whole idea of the net-idenity i'd established on the tape. the noise side slaps too. i'm often surprised with how good it is, once i was convinced i'd taped over my master copy with someone else's shit. if i do say so myself. one day i'll upload the full notes app thing, but i think the zine covers most of it. the first major question posed with a work, right at the beginning: 'how often do you wish you were somebody else?'</p>
